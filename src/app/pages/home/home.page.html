                    Some of these images in this web, are made with AI, that
                    means some of the images, are not created by me or any other
                    person, they are generated by artificial intelligence.

                    What is created by me is the code, the logic, the
                    functionality, and the design of the application. The AI
                    generated images are used to enhance the visual appeal of
                    the application and provide a modern look and feel.
